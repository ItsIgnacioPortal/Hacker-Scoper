## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability you should contact me directly by emailing me at [5990@protonmail.com](mailto:5990@protonmail.com). **Do not** open a public issue on the repository, since this could open the door for bad actors to abuse the vulnerability you've found. 

 You can expect to get a reply from me within 48 hours of making the report. Once I receive your report, I'll verify that the vulnerability exists, and then deploy a fix for all currently supported versions.
